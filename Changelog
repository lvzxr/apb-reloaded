#Changelog



- V2.2

 Modified daily activities on different presets to match name properly. Fixed some incorrect mission final stages in titles. Added new Joker store mod variants in respective colours to localization. Changed killfeed on to show red for enemy on presets where accent is more of a 'positive' or 'team' looking colour. Tweaked graphics file.

- V2.1

 Disabled LevelParticles on all but the max preset because whilst it's nice knowing where objectives are the way they rise is just too annoying. (This had some other stuff that ended up being scuffed and I went back on changes after a day or so)

- V2.0

 Overhauled all files to be compatible with the 64Bit edition of the game, most translated over fine but some needed modifying. Removed no particles, you won't be able to use them in future anyway so no point having them here.

 Slight modification to the High preset ingame making pedestrians appear normal, Enabled LevelParticles on all presets so objective circles should appear, Removed mixed colouring from presets.

- V1.51

 Misc localization fixes, Swapped default mission titles to more traditional final stage then name.

- V1.5

 Minor folder name changes, Graphics file and corresponding localization modified to provide more variety in options, if you want the older one message me on Discord. Taken out Disallowed Shaders to see if I can improve on them. Removed colour from alt mission titles.

- V1.4

 Engine File Overhauled, Added no bloom, Added other ragdoll variants (to stop SKENDES complaining), Fixed faster UI not working and added second option, Modified graphics file to not have MSAA if it was ever working and removed LODBias from every option as a trial.
